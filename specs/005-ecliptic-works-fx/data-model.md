---

### MacroVintage

A point-in-time observation of a macro series — the value that was available on a specific date, not the subsequently revised figure.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| series_id | str | FRED/ALFRED series identifier |
| vintage_date | date | Date on which this value was available |

| value | float | The reported value as of vintage_date |
| currency | str | ISO currency code this series belongs to (nullable for global series) |
| lag_days | int | Observed publication lag in days (reference_period → vintage_date) |

**Source**: ALFRED API (FRED vintage endpoint) for most series; fixed-lag rules for currencies without ALFRED coverage.
**Storage**: `data/raw/macro/{series_id}.parquet`

**Source**: Derived by joining FXPriceBar + MacroVintage + risk score from macro-dashboard.

| is_stale | bool | True if score is older than 7 calendar days |

**Source**: Loaded from macro-dashboard output (`data/outputs/risk_score.parquet` or equivalent).
**Storage**: Read-only from macro-dashboard; cached in `data/processed/risk_score_aligned.parquet` after date alignment.

---

## State Transitions

### Order lifecycle
```
SUBMITTED → FILLED       (normal path)
SUBMITTED → CANCELLED    (manual cancel or session end)
SUBMITTED → FAILED       (connection error or IBKR rejection)
FAILED    → [retry next session]  (not auto-retried same session)
```

### Data pipeline states
```
RAW (Dukascopy/ALFRED) → PROCESSED (feature_matrix) → SIGNAL → EXECUTED → RECONCILED
```

Each stage writes to disk before the next stage begins (artifact-first pattern).
